At the ID-IoT we believe in affecting real change. A too common refrain is that larger governing bodies are all talk, bureacracy and hand-waving about a fuzzy future. We are actively addressing that with the proposal for creating the Strategic Edge IoT Innovation Acceleration Consortium.

The committee for vetting this proposal to form an accelerating consortium is made up of major actors from industry and a wide array of public sector organisations ensuring that beyond just talk. We see action.

The first action in fact will be establishing the communication paths and collaboration tools of this consortium's proposal's committee. Major vendors are already interested and we look forward to selecting the ideal path to fast and effective feedback on the proposal for accelerated strategic initiatives in innovation around IoT and Edge.

There is a lot to cover about this proposal and we look forward to sharing more about it as the committee process gets rolling. Finally more action, than words.
